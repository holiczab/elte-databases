# Relational Model and Introduction

- Dr. E. F. Codd proposed the relational model fordatabase systems in 1970.
- It is the basis for the relational databasemanagement system (RDBMS).
- The relational model consists of the following:
    - Collection of objects or relations
    - Set of operators to act on the relations
    - Data integrity for accuracy and consistency

A relational database is a collection of relations or two dimensional tables.

## Relational Database Properties:

- Can be accessed and modified by executingstructured query language (SQL) statements
- Contains a collection of tables with no physicalpointers
- Uses a set of operators
